This package serves as a ROS wrapper around [invariants_py](https://github.com/trajectory-invariants/invariants_py). 

It shows how invariants_py can be used in a ROS application for:

1. online calculation of trajectory invariants from trajectory data on a ROS topic (e.g. geometry_msgs/Pose)
1. online trajectory generation with continuously changing boundary constraints coming in from a ROS topic

# Installation

# Quickstart
